Ram: Hello?

Shyam: Hi Ram! How's it going?

Ram: Hey Shyam! I'm doing well, just relaxing. What about you?

Shyam: Same here! Just wanted to check in and see what you're up to.

Ram: Not much, just catching up on some work. How about you? Anything exciting?

Shyam: Nah, nothing much. Just thinking about trying that new café in town. Heard it's pretty good.

Ram: Oh, nice! Which one?

Shyam: It's called Café Mocha. They have great reviews online.

Ram: Sounds tempting! Maybe we should go there this weekend.

Shyam: Yeah, sounds like a plan! Let’s set it up.

Ram: Alright, I’ll text you later to confirm the time.

Shyam: Great! Talk soon then.

Ram: Take care, Shyam!

Shyam: You too, Ram! Bye!
