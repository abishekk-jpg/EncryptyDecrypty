Key Features
1- File Encryption: Converts file content into an encrypted form by shifting characters by 100.
2- File Decryption: Reverts the encrypted content back to its original form by reversing the shift.
3- File Display: Shows the current content of the file on the console.
4- Menu-Driven Program: Allows the user to choose actions like encryption, decryption, or viewing the file.
